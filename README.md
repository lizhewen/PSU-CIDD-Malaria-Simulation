## Release Note

This version (v3.3) is developed for the Multiple-Drug-Resistant (MDR) paper. This codebase is based off Dang Nguyen Tran's v3.2 located in [this repo](https://github.com/maciekboni/PSU-CIDD-Malaria-Simulation).

This version has implemented Sporozoite Challenge codes, and a new reporter to output all mutation pair information throughout the simulation.

Under `mdr_analysis` folder, it contains several python scripts to parse output files, compute interquartile ranges for a series (default 100) of files from the same simulation settings, and create visualizations. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook `ipynb` files (named with leading numbers) to view available MDR plots.

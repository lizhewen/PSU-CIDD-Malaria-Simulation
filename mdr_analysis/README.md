# Multiple-Drug-Resistance Analysis & Visualization

This repo contains all the Python codes used to categorize, visualize, and analyze multiple-drug-resistance (MDR) evolution trends.

The Python files (end in `.py`) contain all the plotting functions (for visualizations) and their supporting functions. The Jupyter Notebook files (end in `.ipynb`) are showing the outcome measure calculation functions and evolution trend visualizations for the Multiple-Drug-Resistance (MDR) Analysis, focusing on comparing the Multiple-Firstline-Therapy (MFT) with other strategies.

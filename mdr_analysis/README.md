# Multiple-Drug-Resistance Analysis & Visualization

This repo contains all the Python codes used to categorize, visualize, and analyze multiple-drug-resistance (MDR) evolution trends.

The Python files (end in `.py`) contain all the plotting functions (for visualizations) and their supporting functions. The Jupyter Notebook files (end in `.ipynb`) are showing the outcome measure calculation functions and evolution trend visualizations for the Multiple-Drug-Resistance (MDR) Analysis, focusing on comparing the Multiple-Firstline-Therapy (MFT) with other strategies.

## Legend Coloring

For the genotype evolution trend plots, there are two options of calculating drug-resistance strength -

- Option 1: summarizes / categorizes by each genotype's drug resistance. This options uses `resistant_strength_calc` function and the resistance is formatted as `a-b`, where `a` being  how many drugs the genotype is resistant to, and `b` being how many mutation events occurred with the genotype. Refer to the function def for more info
- Option 2: summarizes by each genotype's drug efficacy
